Digital - Clock ⏰
________________________________________________________________

🎨Project Description:  
Here's an excellent project for beginners: we'll construct a digital analog clock that displays the time in military format, showing hours, minutes, and seconds. I'll provide step-by-step comments
that will guide you through the process of creating your own!

💻 Technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

👩‍🍳Process:  
I began by creating HTML elements for hours, minutes, and seconds, assigning unique IDs to each. This approach allows me to target them individually with JavaScript for precise manipulation.

Next, I moved on to styling my containers and their repsective boxes in my style.css. By applying basic styles such as text-align, background, and transform, I was able to craft an appealing appearance for my clock.

Lastly, I implemented functionality using JavaScript by developing functions that will update the clock in real-time through a set up interval. I also ensured for the display to feature leading zeros to guarante that numbers
have two digits for uniformity and clear visibilty.

📝 Learned:  
🧠 'Date' obejct in JavaScript is a built-in object that provides various methods for working with dates and times. To make my life eaiser, I learned to implement these built in functions.  
Here are a few just to name the least:
- `getDate()` - Returns the date of the month (1-31) for the specified date.
- `getDay()` - Returns the day of the week (0-6) for the specified date, where 0 represents Sunday.
- `getMonth()` - Returns the month (0-11) for the specified date, where 0 represents January.
- `getYear()` - Returns the full year (e.g., 2024) for the specified date.
- `getHours()` - Returns the hour (0-23) for the specified date.
- `getMinutes()` - Returns the minutes (0-59) for the specified date.
- `getSeconds()` - Returns the seconds (0-59) for the specified date.

These are just a few examples of the methods available on the `Date` object. There are several other methods that can be used for various date and time manipulations in JavaScript.

💡Improvement:  
- Enhance the visual appeal of my live server by introducing a wider range of background colors.
-  Implement additional interactive features to engage users.
-  Consider displaying the date or month alongside the time.
-  Introduce personalized greetings such as "Good morning", "Good evening", or "Good night" based on the current time.
